# ai-water-sprayer

This was supposed to be a face recognition program that would extract the face coordinates and names of the targeted users and then 
if the program saw that person in it's view it would activate a relay via Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and that relay would turn on a
water pump which would completely spray the target. But it never got finished.
